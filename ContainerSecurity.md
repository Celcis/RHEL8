#### chroot vs pivot_root
There are security advantages to using pivot_root over chroot, so in practice you should find the former if you 
look at the source code of a container runtime implementation. The main difference is that pivot_root takes advantage of the 
mount namespace; the old root is no longer mounted and is therefore no longer accessible within that mount namespace. 
The chroot system call doesnâ€™t take this approach, leaving the old root accessible via mount points.
